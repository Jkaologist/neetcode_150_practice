### Greedy Algorithms

Are a method for solving optimization problems by taking decisions that result in the most evident and immediate benefit irrespective of the final outcome. It works for cases where minimization or maximization leads to the required solution.

__Examples__:

* Fractional Knapsack: Optimizes the value of items that can be fractionally included in a knapsack with limited capacity.
* Dijkstra’s algorithm: Finds the shortest path from a source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph.
* Kruskal’s algorithm: Finds the minimum spanning tree of a weighted graph.
* Huffman coding: Compresses data by assigning shorter codes to more frequent symbols.
