# Dynamic Programming

### Recursion Recipe

1. Visualize the problem as a tree
2. Identify the base cases
3. Test your algorithm

### Memoization Recipe

1. Add a memo to optimize the solution
2. Add a base case to return memoized values
3. Store values into the memo

### Tabulation Recipe (For 1D)

1. Visualize the problem as a table from tree
2. Size the table based on the inputs
3. Initialize default values in the table
4. Seed the smallest problem's answer
5. Iterate further positions to figure out logic
